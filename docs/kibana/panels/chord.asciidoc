Status: *Stable*

A chord diagram based on the results of an Elasticsearch terms facet.

=== Parameters

sourceField:: The source field on which to computer the facet
size1:: Show this many terms for field 1
targetField:: The target field on which to computer the facet
size2:: Show this many terms for field 2
order:: How the terms are sorted: count, term, reverse_count or reverse_term, before they are filtered
exclude:: terms to exclude from the results
counter_pos:: The location of the legend in respect to the diagram: above, below, or none.

sortingNodes:: Indicates how the nodes are sorted
sortingOrderNodes:: Indicates if the nodes are sorted ascending (true) or descending (false)
segmentSize:: In the default case the attribute 'segmentSize' is set to the value 'outgoing'. That means that the width of a chord on the side of a node indicates how much leaves the node from there. For example if we have a connection from A to B with the value 4, the chord has a width of 4 where it is connected to node A, but a width of 0 at the other side.

numberOfTicks:: defines how many ticks should be displayed. For example a 1 indicates that every tick should be shown, a 4 that every 4th tick is shown
numberOfTicksLabel:: defines that each n th label of a tick is shown. For example a 1 indicates that every label is shown, a 4 that every 4th label is shown
tooltipSetting:: Indicates if tooltips should be shown if the user hovers over a segment or chord
sortingTooltip:: defines by which criteria the connections in the tooltip should be sorted
sortingOrderTooltip:: defines if the nodes should be ordered ascending or descending
tooltipOrientation:: defines if the nodes should be ordered ascending or descending
spyable:: Set spyable to false to disable the inspect button
